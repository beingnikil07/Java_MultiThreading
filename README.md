# ‚öôÔ∏è Java Multithreading Practice

A curated collection of Java programs focused on **multithreading and concurrency**, designed for developers to practice and master parallel processing, synchronization, and thread-safe design patterns.

## üöÄ About

This repository is a **comprehensive practice ground for learning and mastering Java Multithreading**. It includes a wide variety of examples and problems that cover everything from basic thread creation using `Thread` and `Runnable`, to more advanced concepts like inter-thread communication, deadlock detection and prevention, and the use of high-level concurrency utilities from the `java.util.concurrent` package.  
Whether you're preparing for a Java backend interview, learning OS-level thread management, or working on scalable backend systems, this repository is aimed at helping you understand how to write **robust, efficient, and thread-safe Java code**. Practical examples are grouped into categories to help you learn progressively.

## üß† Concepts Covered

- üîÅ Thread creation (`Thread`, `Runnable`)
- üîí Synchronization (`synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Thread lifecycle and states
- üö¶ `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`
- üîÅ Producer-Consumer problem
- ‚ùå Deadlock and avoidance
- üîÉ Executor framework & Thread Pools
- ‚õìÔ∏è CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, Semaphore
- ‚öõÔ∏è Volatile, Atomic variables
- üóÇÔ∏è Thread-safe collections (`ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`)
